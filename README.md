# Product Tracker
I was interested in creating a product logging application for my full stack project.

# User Stories
- Problem: I use a lot of products and would like to categorize them and determine if they work for me
- App idea: A product tracker that logs user info based around product usage
- Who would use it: Anyone who enjoys tracking usage of personal items!

# Technologies Used
- Node.js
- EJS
- Express
- Mongoose

# Wireframes

# Future Features
- A price entry to check how long a product lasts depending on time it took to finish a product
- A user creation MVC structure to have users be able to create accounts and see other's product habits
